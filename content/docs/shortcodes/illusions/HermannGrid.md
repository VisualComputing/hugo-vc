# Hermann Grid
The Hermann grid illusion is an optical illusion reported by Ludimar Hermann in 1870. The illusion is characterized by "ghostlike" grey blobs perceived at the intersections of a white (or light-colored) grid on a black background. The grey blobs disappear when looking directly at an intersection.

## Illusion

Ludimar Hermann, a German physiologist, discovered this illusion reading a physics text in which the figures were printed in a
matrix-like arrengement.
